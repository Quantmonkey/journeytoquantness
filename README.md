# journeytoquantness
A consolidated account of my journey from monkey to quant [And a few other weird things thrown into the mix]
- Journey Started on: 1 Mar 2019
- Correct As Of: 12 May 2022

<b>Current Technical Interests</b>:
Personally interested in the evolution of the DeFi space and exploiting arbitrage and fleeting alpha opportunities in the DeFi space.
I'm also actively reading up on venture capital.

The key technologies I'm looking to pick up and improve are: 
	1. Blockchain Technologies (chain, smart contract), 
	2. Big Data Technologies (scrape, ingest, process) and 
	3. FinML Technologies (finML to be more effective/efficient/robust/generalizable)
	
Obstacles & Solutions:
	1. Blockchain
		a. Need better understanding of Solidity, and some experience writing smart contracts, need to decouple front-end
